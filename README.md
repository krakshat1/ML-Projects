# ML-Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning-based projects, each organized in its own folder. Every project includes:

    📁 A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) demonstrating the entire machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

    📊 Visualizations and metrics for performance analysis.

    🧠 Implementations of popular ML models using libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

    📄 Documentation and comments for easy understanding and reproducibility.

🔍 Projects Overview

Each sub-folder represents a separate ML project. These projects may span across various domains such as:

    Classification (e.g., spam detection, disease prediction)

    Regression (e.g., house price prediction)

    Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation)

    NLP (e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification)

    Computer Vision (e.g., image classification, object detection)

📌 Getting Started

To explore any project:

    Navigate to the project folder.

    Open the Jupyter notebook.

    Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code and interpret the results.
